## Why Google Tasks?

When it comes to selecting the ideal todo list app, there are countless options available, each promising to enhance productivity and streamline task management. After experimenting with numerous highly recommended apps, I ultimately decided on Google Tasks, a choice driven by both personal experience and the app’s
standout features.

One of the primary reasons why I chose Google Tasks is its remarkably intuitive user interface. Unlike some apps that overwhelm users with complex layouts and excessive features, Google Tasks offers a clean, straightforward design that is easy to navigate. This simplicity is crucial for maintaining focus on the tasks at hand, without getting bogged down by unnecessary complications. The app’s UI makes it easy for anyone, regardless of their tech-savviness, to jump in and start organizing their tasks efficiently. Another compelling reason for my choice is how seamlessly Google Tasks integrates with the rest of Google’s ecosystem. As someone who frequently uses Gmail and Google Calendar, I find that Google Tasks fits naturally into my existing workflow.

## Classifying the Google Tasks Features

### **Must-have features**

#### 1. Task priority

**Reason:** Task priority is essential for effective task management, allowing users to focus on what’s most important. By assigning priority levels to tasks, users can ensure that critical tasks are addressed first, enhancing productivity and reducing the risk of missing deadlines.

#### 2. Create, read, edit, and delete task

**Reason:** The ability to create, read, edit, and delete tasks is fundamental to any todo list app. These core functionalities form the backbone of task management, enabling users to maintain an up-to-date list of tasks that reflect their current priorities and commitments. Without these basic operations, the app would fail to serve its primary purpose.

### **Nice-to-have features**

#### 1. Task grouping/listing

**Reason:** Task grouping or listing allows users to categorize tasks into different projects or contexts, making it easier to manage related tasks together. While not essential for all users, this feature enhances organization for those managing multiple projects or areas of responsibility.

#### 2. Task description/note

**Reason:** Adding descriptions or notes to tasks provides users with additional context, ensuring that important details are not forgotten. This feature is particularly useful for complex tasks that require specific instructions or reminders. While beneficial, it’s not critical for basic task management.

### **Unnecessary features**

#### 1. Subtask

**Reason:** Subtasks can complicate the task management process by adding extra layers of organization that may not be necessary for most users. For users who prefer a simple, straightforward todo list, subtasks can create clutter and make the app more difficult to navigate. The simplicity of the app is prioritized to maintain user focus on primary tasks.

### **Missing features**

#### 1. Priority sorting

**Reason:** Priority sorting is a key feature that is currently missing from the app. It allows users to automatically sort tasks based on their priority level, ensuring that the most important tasks are always at the top of the list. This feature would greatly enhance productivity by making it easier for users to focus on their most urgent tasks without manually reordering them.

#### 2. Search task

**Reason:** A search functionality is essential for quickly locating specific tasks, especially as the task list grows. Without this feature, users may struggle to find tasks in a long list, leading to frustration and inefficiency. The ability to search tasks by keywords or tags would significantly improve the user experience.
