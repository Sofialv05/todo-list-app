# My Task App

## Task #1:

For the todolist app i picked Microsoft To-Do. Before making this decision, i've tried many todolist app that people would recommend, and between all of them i choose Microsoft To-Do. The reason i picked this app is simply because how the app UI is pretty much easy to understand, also this todo list app is the one that i used often.
